            <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Combine cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Pour 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
